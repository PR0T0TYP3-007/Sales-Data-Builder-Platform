# Project Test -- Practice (Ghost)

## Detailed PRD — Sales Data Builder Platform

**Audience:** Engineers (no sales or enrichment background)
**Version:** v1.1

---

### 1. What This System Does
This system takes **lists of companies** from files (PDF, CSV, Excel). It:
1.  **Extracts basic details** from those files (company name, phone, address).
2.  **Finds missing details** on the internet (website, social media accounts, etc.).
3.  **Finds employees** who work at those companies, starting with leaders or decision makers.
4.  **Helps users group companies** into categories (like “real estate” or “restaurants”).
5.  **Lets users create workflows** (step-by-step instructions like “Send an email,” “Make a phone call”).
6.  **Creates tasks** from those workflows so users can carry them out.

---

### 2. User Roles
-   **Admin:** sets up account, manages projects.
-   **Manager:** organizes companies into groups, creates workflows.
-   **Team Member:** carries out tasks (sends email, makes calls, logs outcomes).

---

### 3. System Structure
-   **Organization** → top-level container (the company using the software).
-   **Product** → sub-container (like a project or business line). All data inside one Product is separate from others.
-   **Companies** → businesses imported or found.
-   **Contacts** → people working at companies.
-   **Groups** → categories of companies (e.g., “Restaurants in Halifax”).
-   **Workflows** → step-by-step instructions for how to approach companies.
-   **Tasks** → actual actions users must take, generated from workflows.

---

### 4. Workflow (End-to-End)

**Step 1: Upload a File**
-   **User Action:** Upload a PDF/CSV/Excel with company information.
-   **System Action:**
    -   Parse the file.
    -   Extract company name, phone, address, and description if present.
    -   Save to database as “company record” with `status = incomplete`.
-   **Output to User:** Table preview of extracted companies.

---

**Step 2: Fill in Missing Company Info (Automatic Search)**
-   **System Action (for each company):**
    -   Search the web using company name + address.
    -   Try to find official website.
    -   If website found, scrape:
        -   Homepage → description text.
        -   “About” page → longer description.
        -   Footer → phone/email/social links.
    -   If socials found: save URLs (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter).
    -   Detect category/industry from text (keywords like “construction,” “bakery,” etc.).
-   **Output to User:** Company profile page with website, description, socials.

---

**Step 3: Find Employees**
-   **System Action:**
    -   Visit the company’s website “Team” or “About Us” pages.
    -   Collect names, job titles, and emails (if listed).
    -   Classify roles (CEO, CTO, Manager, etc.).
    -   If no employees listed → mark as “no employees found.”
-   **Future Enhancement:** Crawl external sites (like press releases, government filings, or social media mentions) for more employee names.
-   **Output to User:** List of employees per company with roles.

---

**Step 4: Group Companies**
-   **User Action:** Select companies and assign them into groups (e.g., “Restaurants” or “Banks”).
-   **System Action:** Auto-suggest groups based on detected industry keywords.
-   **Output to User:** Saved groups of companies for bulk actions.

---

**Step 5: Create a Workflow**
-   **User Action:** Build a sequence of steps to interact with companies.
-   **System Action:** Workflow builder includes:
    -   Step types: email, phone call, LinkedIn message, event invite, send package.
    -   Delay days (e.g., “Step 2 happens 3 days after Step 1”).
    -   Assign role (who should do it).
    -   Templates (message text, call script).
-   **Output to User:** Saved workflow attached to one group of companies.

---

**Step 6: Generate Tasks**
-   **System Action:** For every company in a group, generate tasks from workflow.
    -   Example:
        -   Task 1: Send intro email to “John Doe” at “ABC Ltd.”
        -   Task 2: (3 days later) Call main phone number of ABC Ltd.
    -   Store each task with `status = pending`.
-   **Output to User:** Task inbox/dashboard with tasks assigned to each team member.

---

**Step 7: Execution & Tracking**
-   **User Action:** Complete tasks in inbox.
-   **System Action:** Mark task as completed with notes.
-   **Output to User:** Dashboard showing progress (tasks done, responses logged).

**contacts**(id, company_id, name, role, email, phone)
**groups**(id, product_id, name, filter JSON)
**workflows**(id, product_id, name, steps JSON)
**tasks**(id, workflow_id, company_id, contact_id, type, due_date, status)
**audit_logs**(id, actor_id, action, entity, entity_id, ts)

## 7. 💤 Rules & Constraints

-   System finds website for ≥60% of companies.
-   Users can create at least one workflow with multiple steps.
-   Tasks are generated and appear in inbox with due dates.
